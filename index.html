<p>My name is Aleksejs&nbsp;Popovs. I usually go by my first name, you can pronounce it like ‘Aleks.’</p>

<p>I am originally from Riga, Latvia, where I graduated from the Riga State Gymnasium #1 in 2016. I got a BSc in Mathematics with Computer Science and in Philosophy from MIT in 2020.</p>

<p>I like theoretical computer science, applied cryptography, philosophy of language, metaphysics, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/popovalexey">weird music</a> (which I strongly believe should be <a href="https://bandcamp.com/aleksejspopovs">purchased DRM-free</a>, not streamed).</p>

<p>I work as a Security Engineer at Duolingo. Before, I have worked on improving the performance of the open-source zero-knowledge cryptography libraries <a href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark">libsnark</a> and <a href="https://github.com/scipr-lab/libiop">libiop</a> and interned on the Product Security team at Dropbox and with the Cryptography Services practice at NCC Group.</p>

<p>If you'd like to know how I'm doing, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/aleksejspopovs">my twitter</a>. If you'd like to say hi, email me at <a href="mailto:aleksejs@popovs.lv">aleksejs@popovs.lv</a>.</p>
