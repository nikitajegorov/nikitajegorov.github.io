<h1>Personal Statement</h1>

<p>
    I always saw a sort of magic in mathematics. I notice math everywhere, sometimes in unexpected places. Of course,
    math has aided my study of physics, chemistry and programming, my three other favorite disciplines. Getting ahead
    in math helped me in physics, for example, and that felt quite magical. And then there is math in photography - for
    example, the omnipresent Golden Ratio. I want to continue studying math at the university to explore its magic
    better.

    Since math was my favorite subject at school, in 2013, I applied to a high school with a strong focus on
    exact sciences. Riga State Gymnasium Nr 1, Latvia's top-ranked high school, has a strong focus on math and exact
    sciences and requires a high level of commitment: we had 9 hours of math a week, and as much time in other exact
    sciences. I also attend various regional and international olympiads in math and exact sciences. Thanks to the
    intense training at my high-school, I finished in the nation's top 25 in the international math contest. Outside
    of the Gymnasium, I also have learned to do science in an applied way. Since 2010, I attended ABFS, a
    science-focused Sunday school. We met once a week for classes and in summers for project camps dedicated to
    various topics. There I wrote a research paper on Dissipation of Light and learned, for example, why mathematically
    speaking the clear sky is light blue. Furthermore, I also like electronics and programming, two other subjects with
    a lot of connections to math. I have enjoyed several extra-curricular courses in these subjects. For example,
    I have assembled robots in a small radio-electronics group at the Riga Youth Palace. I have also successfully
    graduated from a six-year coding school in Riga. Additionally, last summer, I completed a 160 hour Accenture
    Software Engineering Boot camp: an entrance event for future programmers. All of these activities helped me
    understand how math can be applied in the real world and at work. This understanding motivates me to keep studying
    it.

    Upon graduation, I was admitted to the University of Latvia, where I'm currently studying mathematics at the
    undergraduate level. The first two months showed that mathematics is even more interesting when it goes beyond the
    school curriculum. The deeper I dive, the more fun the journey becomes. This is a good indication that I made the
    right choice. Additionally, to my studies, I work as a programmer at a local IT company. What makes this job
    especially interesting, is that here I have a unique opportunity to apply what I have learned at the university in
    practice. This motivates me to keep studying even more.

    Leadership and community work are other essential aspects of my personality. I am a member of the School Council,
    where we meet once a week to organize all school events. On weekends, I work as a volunteer in the already
    mentioned ABFS as a teacher's assistant for the incoming students. These activities have taught me to lead,
    communicate and cooperate.

    I want to study in the United Kingdom, because of its unique culture and the quality of math education. That
    is why I am applying to British universities with strong mathematics faculties. Right now I am most excited about
    such subjects as Probability and Analysis, but I am sure there will be many more fascinating topics to discover.
    Also, I think it would be important to get to know another culture. I am a native Russian speaker, born in Latvia
    and for six years I attend a Latvian language high-school. Cultural immersion exposes differences and similarities.
    I want to enrich my cultural palette with knowledge of other cultures and continue to build bridges of
    understanding between different European communities. Bachelor degree in the UK is the best way to learn about
    different cultures.
